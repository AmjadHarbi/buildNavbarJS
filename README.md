# Landing Page Project

#ّّIntroduction

This is the second project in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND). We intend to build a multi-section landing page with an auto-updating navigational menu, plus indicating as "active" the portion that is currently visible to users. Furthermore, the page scrolls to the top when selecting the "to top" button from the navbar menu.



## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
